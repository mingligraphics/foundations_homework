It's The End Of The World ,2008,/its-the-end-of-the-world-lyrics-rem.html,10,"That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it

Losing My Religion ,2003,/losing-my-religion-lyrics-rem.html,9,"Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream"

Selingkar Kasih ,2010,/selingkar-kasih-lyrics-rem.html,7,"Seharusnya cinta kita bisa tersenyum
Seolah seorang puteri ayu
Akan menjadi idaman mahkota hati

Tetapi selingkar oh kasihmu
Telah terurai meragut dan menyakar
Hati ini jua
Masih lagi selingkar kasihmu
Yang menghantui prasedar dan merayu
Rindu daku jua
Oh...
Kepastian yang ku nanti
Tetapi engkau masih mencari
Cinta yang lain
Bukan dariku
Seharusnya cinta ini bisa berdiri
Sebagai sebuah istana megah
Menjadi persinggahan mahkota hati
Melambang kebahagian kita kasih"

The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight ,2006,/the-sidewinder-sleeps-tonight-lyrics-rem.html,7,"This here is the place i will be staying.
there isn't a number. you can call the pay phone.
let it ring a long, long, long, long time.
if i don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more.
if i don't pick up, pick up... the sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
There are scratches all around the coin slot
like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up,
but this machine can only swallow money.
you can't lay a patch by computer design.
it's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs.
Tell her,
tell her she can kiss my ass, then laugh and say that you were only kidding.
that way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me.
today i need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial.
a can of beans or blackeyed peas, some nescafe and ice,
a candy bar, a falling star, or a reading of doctor seuss;
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way,
always had a smile and a reason to pretend.
but their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream.
the sidewinder sleeps on his back.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
We've got to moogie, moogie, move on this one."
Nightswimming ,2003,/nightswimming-lyrics-rem.html,6,"Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still its so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day
Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
That bright tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming
You, I thought I knew you
You, I can not judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming
The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night"
Everybody Hurts ,2003,/everybody-hurts-lyrics-rem.html,6,"When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on
Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts"
Fall On Me ,2011,/fall-on-me-lyrics-rem.html,6,"There's a problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towers
Foresight isn't anything at all
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me
(Well I would keep it above but then it wouldn't be sky any more)
(So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home)
Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky, and ask the sky
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Fall on me
Fall on me (what is it up in the air for)

It's The End of The World as We Know It ,2008,/its-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-lyrics-rem.html,3,"That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it

We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever
I wish to meet each one of you
And you meet you, if I can, and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)

There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone
Let it ring a long, long, long, long time

If I don't pick up, pick up
The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up
But this machine can only swallow money
You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs
Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
A can of beans or blackeyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her, oh
The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up, call me when you try to wake her
I can always sleep standing up. Call me when you try to wake her, oh

The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes,
bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love,
make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine.
These words, ""You will be mine.""
These words, ""You will be mine."" all the time. oh
I tripped and fell, and did I fall.
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
You know with love come strange currencies
and here is my appeal:
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance,
a word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
These words, ""You will be mine""
These words, ""You will be mine."" all the time. oh
These words, ""You will be mine.""
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray,
say, love's confined, on Earth"

Investigation dance? Those ants in pants glances
Well, look behind the eyes, it's a hallowed hollow anesthetized
Save my own ass, screw these guys, smoke and mirror lock down

You might have hidden your frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around

Leaving New York, never easy

Now life is sweet, and what it brings I tried to take
But loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in wait
And all not lost, still in my eye
Shadow of necklace across your thigh
I might have lived my life in a dream, but I swear it, this is real
Memory fuses and shatters like glass
Mercurial future, forget the past
But it's you, it's what I feel
You might have laughed if I told you (It's pulling me apart)

'Cause on my love you can depend
I see your face before me, as I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking of all the things we said
You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do

Living Well Is The Best Revenge ,2008,/living-well-is-the-best-revenge-lyrics-rem.html,2,"It's only when your poison spreads
Into the life you hope to live
And suddenly you wake up
In a shaking panic, now
You set me up like a lamb to slaughter
Garbo ask the farmer's daughter
Unbelievable the gospel according to who
I lay right down
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well is the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
Try turn your talking points on me
History will set me free
The future's ours and you don't even read
The footnote now
So who's chasing me? Where did you go?
You disappear mid sentence sinner
In a judgment crisis I see my anecdote fall out
You weakened shell
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
You say it with your dying breath
Well I forgive but I don't forget
You work it out, let's hear that argument
Count the count of three go, now
All you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to them
Well I'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well is the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I am calling you on that
Baby, I'm calling you on, oh

Follow the leader, run and turn into butter

Let's begin again like Martin Luthers in
The mythology begins the begin
Answer me a question, I can't itemize
I can't think clearly, look to me for reason

Beat A Drum ,2014,/beat-a-drum-lyrics-rem.html,2,"The sun reflected in the back of my eye
I knocked my head against the sky.
The dragonflies are busy buzzing me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.
Halfway from coal, halfway to diamond.
My fall knocked a mean chip out of me.
I'm gathering as far as I can reach
We're perched upon the precipice
And this is what I've seen.
This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.
A bluejay hectors from the felled Catalpa tree
A doctorate in science and a theologian's dream.
The dragonflies are trying to lecture me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.
This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.
Beat a drum for me, like a butterfly wing
Tropical storm across the ocean.
Don't explain, I'm sure I'll want to know.
Don't forget, we're just halfway from coal.

I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.
Don't darken my doorstep again,
You're mixing up living in chin-chin,
You're mixing up lose with win-win,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.
You stumble on glass top table,
TV's chewing shock-gone cable
Pump me up a beanstalk fable
And I'll call this entertainment
'cause Humpty's falling down.
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.
Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night f**kin' fried-up pub crawl

I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonight

Walk Unafraid ,2006,/walk-unafraid-lyrics-rem.html,1,"As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down
These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb, a little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laid
They claim to walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Say ""Keep within the boundaries if you want to play""
Say ""Contradiction only makes it harder""
How can I be what I want to be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up
And walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fall
To walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high"

Bittersweet Me ,2006,/bittersweet-me-lyrics-rem.html,2,"I move across, innocence lost

I move across the earth in my new pattern shirt
I pass satellites

I can't give you anything
I don't know who you're livin' for
I don't who you are anymore
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
I move across, candy floss
I move like a tank
I move across the room with a heart full of gloom
I'm stronger than you think
Oh, my peer, your veneer
Is wearing thin and cracking
The surface informs that underneath
The underneath is lacking
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore

All static and desire
You're blue in the face from navel gaze
You set yourself on fire
You strip down and lay yourself out
I know you can't fake it
But are you tired and naked?
Are you tired and naked?
Yeah, I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this

Halloween night
I've had enough to drink to make my own party
All my fellow riders in half costume, half asleep
Half silly, gone to seed
I don't mark my time with dates, holidays, faded wisdom, locked karma, whatever's
Convenient
I am made by my times
I am a creation of now
Shaken with the cracks and crevices
I'm not giving up easy
I will not fold
I don't have much
But what I have is gold
(I saw your face
You drift in snow
And I drift in snow)
I sing in platinum
I dress in brass
I eat in zinc
Let it pass
Compare a toast
I like that
I understand courage
I still roll with the shout of a character I was married to today
I try to see outside myself
I understand the eyes
Excuse all the highs
Sorry
I am sorry

I like your face)
I like you, love you, every coast of you.
I've seen your eddies and tides and hurricanes and cyclones.
Low ebb tide and high, full moon.
Up close and distant.
I read you like the sky, the sea, the ocean, the sun, the moon.

Naked and blue.

Breathing with you)
Breathing with you. Touch. Change. Shift. Allow air. Window open. Drift. Drift away. Into now.

And they just turned away
I doesn't bother me by the light of day
But at night... I hear your call
Late at night... I hear your call
I saw the mirror that you broke today
I saw the ceiling falling down your way
When they looked at you, you could turn away
You didn't bother then by the light of day... you'll stay
But at night... I hear your call

Me and glasses Saturday slump
You and your shopping, I looked up
Our eyes met, mine are green
You'd had a peroxide thing
Call now, look me up
Sunday walk, Weaver's Park,
I was on the lakeside
Where the playgrounds meet
In bare feet
You said, ""Mighty cold today""
You never see what I think
You didn't like your daytime job
I was born to travel
You were a camera, I dropped my keys
I'm on the northbound, you were asleep
I said, ""Are you holding?""
""You wanna ride the silent sky?""
I wrote a story on the fly
You in the tabletop
I said, ""I've had enough of the city.""
I held a bag of apples
You at the last table
I had had a soy dog
Cafe streetside, Tuesday bloom
You wanna be on fire, I said I hung the moon
Wednesday grocery, corner of Vine,
You were in the checkout line
I dropped my frozen dinners, you helped pick them up
Thursday cab rush, our block,
You with broken accent, my heart stopped
You laughed, I worry
Chance, chance, chance, chance
Swarming like a dozen crushing blows
All those glances, midtime dances
Chance
I never looked it up
You hit the sidewalk talking
Said, ""I'd read the ads""
Do you?
Where are you? Will you read this? Can I see?
This is surely moving faster than I can think
A minute shy, a passing eye
I know I saw you there
Will you read this? Can I see? What did I see?

Swimming like a dozen crushing blows
All those midtime dances

I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
It's furious balancing

I'll squeeze into heaven and Valentine

Reckoning
(Don't Go Back To) Rockville
Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus.
Going to place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough.
Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know.
You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left to go.
Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself.
I know if might sound strange but I believe you'll be coming back before too long.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.
At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend I don't care that you're not here with me.
Cause it's so much easier to handle all my problems if I'm too far out to sea.
But something better happen soon or it's gonna be too late to bring you back.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.
It's not as though I really need you.
If you were here I'd only bleed you.
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and that's not how it ought to be.
I know it might sound strange but I believe you'll be coming back before too long.
Don't go back to Rockville.

anything to thin the blood

Falls To Climb ,2006,/falls-to-climb-lyrics-rem.html,0,"Falls To Climb
I'll take the position
Assume the missionary part
You work by committee,
You had me pegged from the start.
I'll be pounce pony,
Phoney maroney,
Pony before the cart.
I'll be pounce pony.
This ceremony
Only fills my heart.
Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me?
A punch toy volunteer
A weakling on its knee.
Is all you want to hear
And all you want to see.
Romantically, you'd martyr me
And miss this story's point
It is my strength, my destiny
This is the role that I have chosen.
Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me?
Gentlemen mark your opponents
Fire into your own ranks.
Pick the weakest as strategic
Move. Square off. To
Meet your enemy.
For each and every gathering
A scapegoat falls to climb.
As I step forward, silently.
Deliberately mine.
Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me? Why not me.
Had consequence chose differently
Had fate its ugly head
My actions make me beautiful
And dignify the flesh
Me. I am free. Free."
Feeling Gravity's Pull ,2006,/feeling-gravitys-pull-lyrics-rem.html,0,"I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph.

Peel back the mountains peel back the sky
Stomp gravity into the floor

Let me show you what I can do with it
Time and distance are out of place here
Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
When the light is mine
I felt gravity pull
Somewhere near the end it said
You can't do this
I said, I can too
Ships sway, rivers shift
Oceans form and mountains drift
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it
Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed

Final Straw ,2008,/final-straw-lyrics-rem.html,0,"""As I raise my head to broadcast my objection
As your latest triumph draws the final straw
Who died and lifted you up to perfection?
And what silenced me is written into law.
I can't believe where circumstance has thrown me
And I turn my head away
If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.
Not again. Not today. Not today.
If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow
And forgiveness takes a back seat to revenge
There's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected
There's a voice in me that says you will not win.
And if I ignore the voice inside,
Raise a half glass to my home.
But it's there that I am most afraid,
And forgetting doesn't hold.
It doesn't hold. Now I don't believe and I never did
That two wrongs make a right.
If the world were filled with the likes of you
Then I'm putting up a fight. Putting up a fight.
Putting up a fight. Make it right. Make it right.
Now love cannot be called into question.
Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.
And love-- love will be my strongest weapon.
I do believe that I am not alone.
For this fear will not destroy me.
And the tears that have been shed
It's knowing now where I am weakest
And the voice in my head. In my head.
Then I raise my voice up higher
And I look you in the eye
And I offer love with one condition.
With conviction, tell me why.
Tell me why.
Tell me why.
Look me in the eye.
Tell me why."""

When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor not to tell
I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract
Explain the change, the difference between
What you want and what you need, there's the key
Your adventure for today, what do you do
Between the horns of the day
I believe
My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in
When I was young and give and take, and foolish said my fool awake
When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor, on your honor
Trust in your calling, make sure your calling's true
Think of others, the others think of you
Silly rule, golden words make practice, practice makes perfect
Perfect is a fault, and fault lines change
I believe
My humor's wearing thin and change is what I believe in
I believe
My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in
When I was young and full of grace, and spirited a rattlesnake
When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor, on your honor

Example is the checker to the key

My humor's wearing thin and I believe the poles are shifting

My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in"

You're Yul Brenner Westworld
Reporting from the field.
I threw it into reverse,
Made a motion to repeal.
You kicked my legs from under me,
And tried to take the wheel.
I told you I wanted to be wrong,
But everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand.
Now I know that the sun has shined on my side of the street.
The basket of America, the weevils and the wheat.
The milk and honeyed congregation, scrubbed and apple-cheeked
Salute Apollo 13 from the rattle jewelry seats.
Mythology's seductive and it turned a trick on me
That I have just begun to understand.
I told you I wanted to be wrong,
But everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand.
The rodeo is staged, gold circle goat-ropers and clowns.
A rumble in the third act, tie 'em up and burn 'em down.
We're armed to the teeth, born a little breech;
Blue-plate special analysts, cells and SUV's
We can't approach the Allies 'cause they seem a little peeved
And speak a language we don't understand.
I told you I wanted to be wrong
But everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand.
(Prop up The Omega Man, we're primed for victory,
God gave us the upper hand, there's honor among thieves.
Temper it with arrogance, a dash of sad conceit.
The top's down on the T-Bird, we're the children of the free)
Storm into the boardroom of the conquering elite.
Did you recognize the madman who is shouting in the streets?
Destroy the things that I don't understand
Destroy the things that I don't understand."

They sing through life so why cant we?

You claim your best

The nighttime creases
Summer schemes
And stretches out to stay.
The sun shines down
You came around
You love easy days.
But now the sun,
The winters come.
I wanted just to say
That if I hold
I'd hope youd fold
Open up inside, inside of me.

As birds take wing
They sing through life so why can't we?
You cling to this
You claim your best
If this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain

I'll sing along

I'll walk alone

Celebrate the rain.

Kohoutek ,2006,/kohoutek-lyrics-rem.html,1,"Who will stand alone
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Courage built a bridge, jealousy tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
And like Kohoutek you were gone
We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talked
She wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped
Like a fish, like a flying friend
You were gone, like Kohoutek, can't forget that
Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow who will stand alone
Maybe you're not the problem, scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Michael built a bridge, Michael tore it down

You might have hidden your frown
You might have succeeded in changing me

But loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in wait
And all not lost, still in my eye

Memory fuses and shatters like glass
Mercurial future, forget the past

Gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get
I'm on a permanent vacation
Nothing left to move
I want a revelation
Nothing left to prove
I could take it with me
Leave you all behind
Got some kind of feeling
Burnin' on my mind
Sleeping late in the morning
Stay out all night long
Every day is like the one before
I'm going wrong
I'm going wrong
I'm on a permanent vacation
Nothing left to move
I want a revelation
Nothing left to prove
I could take it with me
Leave you all behind
Got some kind of feeling
Burnin' on my mind
There's only one thing you can do
This I gotta do, oh, oh, oh
I got nothing to win, nothing to lose
Nothing left to prove
One thing to do
Well, I'm on a permanent vacation
I'm on a permanent vacation

Photograph ,2006,/photograph-lyrics-rem.html,0,"(Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe/Natalie Merchant)
I found this photograph,
Underneath the broken picture glass
Tender face of black and white,
Beautiful, a haunting sight
Looked into an angel's smile,
Captivated all the while
From the hair and clothes she wore,
I'd place her in between the wars
Was she willing when she sat
And posed the pretty photograph?
Save her flowering and fair,
The days to come, the days to share
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more
I found this photograph,
Stashed between the old joist walls,
In a place where time is lost,
Lost behind, where all things fall
Broken books and calendars,
Letters script in careful hand,
Music too, a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band
From the threshold what's to see
Of our brave new century?
The television's just a dream,
The radio, the silver screen
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more
Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day,
Was she hopeful, did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside,
Family secrets, sworn to hide?
Did she feel the beat that stirs,
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend,
The love and laughter, 'til the end?"

Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.
Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.
This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.
Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.
Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.
Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.
Everyone hates a sad professor.

The keys in the cooler, it's 3 A.M.
And Saturn is beckoning no one
Is off on its own
Is offering up
Late shift convenience store
Cut out the lights
Telescope roof towards the northwestern sky
You pull the ladder up
No one's the wiser
You find your sights and discover
Saturn is orbiting nothing
Is off on its own
Is breaking from home
Harder to look yourself square in the eye
Easy to take off
You found the ladder in the pattern of your wrist
You've seen and you've marked horizons
Mother was difficult, she made you cry
Cover the mirror, look to the sky
You climb into your rocket ship triumph
Lift up and hold out your hands
Saturn is orbiting nothing
Is off on its own
Is breaking from home
Saturn is orbiting nothing
Is off on its own
Is breaking from home

Throw them into a new gravity

Of her earlier incarnations
Now looked back on, weren't rich
And loaded with beautiful vulnerability
And now she knows

Now is greater, now is greater.
And she knows that

Stir up the trappings

And now is greater than the whole of the past
Is greater, and now she knows that.

If you can't hit play cause the button sticks

There's a new planet in the solar system
There is nothing up my sleeve

I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground
In all this talk of time, talk is fine
But I don't want to stay around
Why can't we pantomime
Just close our eyes
And sleep sweet dreams
Me and you with wings on our feet
I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground
I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom

I want the humming birds, the dancing bears
Sweetest dreams of you

I look into the moon

The Lifting ,2006,/the-lifting-lyrics-rem.html,1,"Grounded, 5 A.M.
The nitelite is comforting,
But gravity is holding you.
Once settled into sleep
You have watched, on repeat,
The story of your life
Across the ceiling;
And in review,
You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen
""Good morning, and how are you?
The weather's fine, the sky is blue -
It's perfect for our seminar...""
""Now close your eyes,
And start to breathe.
Allow the noise to recede...
...Allow yourself to drift and fly away.""
But you just stay.
You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen, never dreamed.
Did you hear these voices calling
Locked into the conference room,
""We're only what our minds assume...""
And rationale is leaving you.
This conceit, these systems of belief,
Your counselor agrees,
""You've always marked these boundaries, now you're free...""
And with relief.
You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen, never heard, never dreamed.
You've said the air was singing
It's calling you, you don't believe
These things you've never seen
Never, never, never.
Once you had a dream
Of oceans, and sunken cities;
Memories of things you've never known
And you have never known."

Wait ,2006,/wait-lyrics-rem.html,0,"You got your problems darling
I got mine too
You know that
maybe it's time for you to come through
Because I'm fed up with waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
what are you gonna do?
I've almost given up hope
then what else is new?
You know that
I'm at the end of my rope trying to hang on to you
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
what are you gonna do
You better wait (WAIT!)
Don't go away now darling, wait (WAIT)
Why don't you stay?
You better wait (WAIT!)
Don't go away now, wait (WAIT!)

Why don't you stay?
I know that you're confused
it's no crime
You better hurry Sugar
'cause we're running out of time
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast

Walk Unafraid ,2006,/walk-unafraid-lyrics-rem.html,1,"As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down
These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb, a little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laid
They claim to walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Say ""Keep within the boundaries if you want to play""
Say ""Contradiction only makes it harder""
How can I be what I want to be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up
And walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fall
To walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high"

Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death
On the Wall of Death
All the World is far from me
On the Wall of Death
It's the nearest to being free
Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the use of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall of Death
You are going nowhere when you ride on the carousel

Hang your collar up inside

All your fallen heroes
Held and dyed and skinned alive
Listen to the Congress fire
Offering the educated
Primitive and loyal
Welcome to the occupation
Hang your collar up inside
Hang your freedom higher
Listen to the buyer still
Listen to the Congress
Where we propagate confusion
Primitive and wild
Fire on the hemisphere below

Copper, steel and cattle
An annotated history
The forest for the fire
Where we open up the floodgates
Freedom reigns supreme

Wendell Gee ,2006,/wendell-gee-lyrics-rem.html,0,"That's when Wendell Gee
Takes a tug upon the string
That held the line of trees
Behind the house he lived in
He was reared to give respect
But somewhere down the line he chose
To whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves
He had a dream one night
That the tree had lost its middle
So he built a trunk of chicken wire
To try and hold it up
But the wire, the wire turned to lizard skin
And when he climbed it sagged
There wasn't even time to say
Goodbye to Wendell Gee
So whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves
There wasn't even time to say
Goodbye to Wendell Gee
So whistle as the wind blows
And listen as the wind blows through the leaves
If the wind were colors
And if the air could speak
Then whistle as the wind blows
And whistle as the wind blows through the leaves"

I proclaim that claims are left unstated
I demand a rematch
I decree a stalemate
I divine my deeper motives

This is my mistake, let me make it good

And I will be the one to knock it down

Hold me tight
Hold that memory
Let my machine talk to me
Let my machine talk to me
This is my world, and I am the World Leader Pretend
This is my life, and this is my time
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed
