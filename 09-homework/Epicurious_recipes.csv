Sear half of the tentacles (don’t try to do more than half—you don’t want to crowd the pan), turning once halfway through, until lightly charred and opaque, 2–3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining tentacles, adding more oil if needed. Add a little more oil, then sear half of the bodies, turning once and picking up with tongs so that any liquid that has accumulated inside bodies can pour off into skillet and evaporate, until lightly charred and opaque, 2–3 minutes. Transfer to plate with cooked tentacles. Repeat with remaining bodies. Thinly slice bodies, then transfer squid to bowl with cucumber mixture and toss to coat.

recipe,Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables,This technique is nothing short of amazing—even if you're finicky about your pickles.,4,100%,/recipes/food/views/quick-pickled-charred-grilled-vegetables,"1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar or cider vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 bay leaves
2 cloves garlic, sliced
2 pounds vegetables of your choice","                                        Put the vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and add the garlic. When it cools, pour it into a large, nonreactive metal or glass bowl.
                                    
                                        Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium-high direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean.
                                    
                                        Prep the vegetables. Put the vegetables on the grill directly over the fire. (For smaller pieces, use a perforated grill pan, or skewer them to make them easier to handle.) Close the lid and cook the vegetables, turning them as necessary, until they brown deeply on all sides without softening; how long this takes will depend on the vegetable and how hot the fire is, but figure between 5 and 15 minutes total for most vegetables. Stay close to the grill, check them early and often, and move them to cooler parts of the grill to control the coloring.
                                    
                                        As they finish, transfer them to the bowl with the brine. When all are done, toss the vegetables with the brine to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate, tossing the vegetables every 30 minutes so, until the flavor and texture fully develop, at least 3 hours. Serve right away, or keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
                                    
 Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables with Chile, Lime, and Star Anise:
Perfect with Vietnamese noodles, soups, and salads: For the brine, use 1 1/2 cups rice vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 5 pods star anise. After the liquid simmers, add the grated zest of 1 lime and 1 sliced jalapeño or Thai bird chile (remove the seeds for less heat).
                                    
 Sweeter Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables with Ginger:
Akin to sweet-and-Sour Chinese and Korean pickles: For the brine, use 1 cup each rice vinegar and sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/3 cup thinly sliced or julienne fresh ginger. After the sugar dissolves in Step 1, let the brine bubble gently for another 15 minutes to develop the ginger flavor.
                                    
 Spicy Dilly Pickled Vegetables:
Terrific made with green beans or okra: In Step 1, substitute 1 tablespoon dill seeds and 2 teaspoons red chile flakes for the mustard and coriander seeds. After adding the vegetables, toss in several fresh dill sprigs if you like.

                                        Working with 1 fillet at a time, season with kosher salt on both sides and dredge in cornstarch, shaking off excess. Dip in egg mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl, then coat in panko, pressing to adhere before shaking off excess. Repeat steps to make a second coating. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fillets.
                                    
                                        Pour oil into a large heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, to come 1"" up sides. Heat oil over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350°F–365°F (Don’t let the tip of the thermometer touch the bottom of the skillet). Carefully lower a fillet along the side of skillet closest to you and let slide away from you into oil. Carefully swirl oil in skillet and cook fish just until golden on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, carefully turn fish over and cook until golden on the other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer fish to wire rack in prepared baking sheet and season with sea salt while still hot. Repeat with remaining fillets.
                                    
                                        Toss cucumbers, fennel, onion, chile, cilantro oil, and a pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl and top with some cilantro.
                                    
                                        Serve fish with cucumber ceviche and lime wedges.

recipe,Charred Romaine Greek Salad With Quinoa-Crusted Feta,"I live in New York, where Greek salads are a reliable diner staple. I love the combination of briny Kalamata olives and salty feta cheese mixed with crisp romaine lettuce and refreshing cucumbers. This somewhat deconstructed, twenty-first century version applies the ""warm goat cheese salad"" method to a Greek salad, coating fresh feta slices in egg wash and quinoa and then pan-frying. The result is incredibly delicious—and as good as it looks in the picture!",4,100%,/recipes/food/views/charred-romaine-greek-salad-with-quinoa-crusted-feta-56389585,"1/2 cup (2 ounces /60 grams) Kalamata olives, finely chopped
1/2 cup parsley, dill, and mint, chopped
1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup (2 ounces/60 milliliters) red wine vinegar
6 tablespoons (3 ounces/90 milliliters) extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup (1 ounce/30 grams) quinoa flour
1 large egg white
1 cup (6 ounces/180 grams) Basic Quinoa or Pilaf-Style Quinoa
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
8 ounces/225 grams feta cheese, drained and cut into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter slices
Vegetable oil for frying
4 heads romaine lettuce, washed and dried
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups (12 ounces/360 grams) Skillet-Toasted Quinoa or Pilaf-Style Quinoa, warmed
1 1/4 cups Sweet and Tangy Roasted Tomatoes
1 English cucumber, scrubbed, ends trimmed, and cut into 1/2-inch/1.25-centimeter half moons
Pepperoncini
Lemon wedges","                                        1. In a medium bowl, stir together the olives, herbs, onion, vinegar, and oil. Set aside.
                                    
                                        2. Spread the quinoa flour out on a large plate. Beat the egg white in a small bowl. Combine the quinoa with the oregano and red pepper flakes and spread it out on a second large plate. Coat each slice of feta with quinoa flour, dip it in the egg white, and then coat it in the quinoa mixture, pressing down to adhere. Add enough oil to a large skillet to reach 1/2 inch/1.25 centimeters up the sides of the skillet. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook the feta until the quinoa is crisp and the cheese looks melted, about 2 minutes per side. With tongs or a spatula, carefully transfer the feta onto a cutting board. Cut each slice crosswise into roughly 1 inch/2.5-centimeter pieces.
                                    
                                        3. Adjust an oven rack to the uppermost position and set the broiler to high (don't adjust the rack if you have a broiler drawer). Remove and discard any of the lettuce's outermost leaves that are damaged. Cut each head in half lengthwise. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with foil. Arrange the lettuce halves, cut side up, on the baking sheets. Season them with salt and pepper and drizzle them with olive oil. Turn them cut side down.
                                    
                                        4. Broil one of the baking sheets of lettuce until it begins to char, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove it from the oven, turn the lettuce halves cut side up, and broil until charred, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Set the baking sheet on a cooling rack and repeat with the second tray.
                                    
                                        5. Divide the lettuce among 8 plates. Top each lettuce half with a 1/4 cup of quinoa, roasted tomatoes, and cucumber slices. Stir the vinaigrette to recombine it and spoon some over each salad. Top with the feta and serve with pepperoncini and lemon wedges.
